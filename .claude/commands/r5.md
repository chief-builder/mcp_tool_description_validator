---

Apply the Rule of Five to the current work.

Target: $ARGUMENTS (or the most recent output if not specified)

The Rule of Five means reviewing 5 times until the agent says "this is as good as it can get."

Pass 1: Basic review - obvious issues, bugs, typos
Pass 2: Deeper review - edge cases, error handling
Pass 3: Broader review - architecture fit, design concerns
Pass 4: Existential review - are we solving the right problem?
Pass 5: Final polish - converge and declare done

After each pass, make improvements. Continue until convergence.
